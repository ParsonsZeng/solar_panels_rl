abstract = {This article analyzes the optimal choice of the tilt angle for the solar panel in order to collect the maximum solar irradiation. In this paper, the collector surface is assumed to be facing toward equator. The study is based upon the measured values of daily global and diffuse solar radiation on a horizontal surface. It is shown that the optimal angle of tilt (??opt) for each month, allows us to collected the maximum solar energy for Madinah site. Annual optimum tilt angle is found to be approximately equal to latitude of the location. It is found that the loss in the amount of collected energy when using the yearly average fixed angle is around 8{\%} compared with the monthly optimum tilt ??opt. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In the present study, performance results of two double axis sun tracking photovoltaic (PV) systems are analyzed after one year of operation. Two identical 7.9. kWp PV systems with the same modules and inverters were installed at Mugla University campus in October 2009. Measured data of the PV systems are compared with the simulated data. The performance measurements of the PV systems were carried out first when the PV systems were in a fixed position and then the PV systems were controlled while tracking the sun in two axis (on azimuth and solar altitude angles) and the necessary measurements were performed. Annual PV electricity yield is calculated as 11.53. MW. h with 1459. kW. h/kWp energy rating for 28 fixed tilt angle for each system. It is calculated that 30.79{\%} more PV electricity is obtained in the double axis sun-tracking system when compared to the latitude tilt fixed system. The annual PV electricity fed to grid is 15.07. MW. h with 1908. kW. h/kWp for the double axis sun-tracking PV system between April-2010 and March-2011. The difference between the simulated and measured energy values are less than 5{\%}. The results also allow the comparison of different solutions and the calculation of the electricity output. ?? 2012.},

@article{Hsu2009,
abstract = {A reinforcement learning (RL) method for quality of service (QoS)-aware power management (PM) of an energy harvesting wireless sensor network, named QoS-aware RLPM, is proposed in this paper. The RL environment for each sensor node is represented by the observable measurements of harvesting energy and residual energy stored in the battery. To achieve QoS-awareness, the proposed QoS-aware RLPM attempts to satisfy various QoS demands by adjusting the duty-cycle rate of sensor node according to the observable measurements. The outcomes of these interactions are evaluated by rewards that express how well the duty-cycle rate adjustments satisfy QoS requests under energy neutrality criteria. The QoS-aware RLPM learns the adjustment strategy of the duty-cycle rate by interacting with the environment and at the same time the QoS of the sensor network is maintained. Experiment results show that the proposed method satisfies the QoS requests under the energy neutrality criteria and performs better than the adaptive duty-cycling method.},

@article{Rizk2008,
abstract = {The problem with a design like this is that phototransistors have a narrow range of sensitivity, once they have been set up in a circuit under set bias conditions. It was because of this fact that solar cells themselves were chosen to be the sensing devices. They provide an excellent mechanism in light intensity detection – because they are sensitive to varying light and provide a near-linear voltage range that can be used to an advantage in determining the present declination or angle to the sun. As a result, a simple triangular set-up was proposed, with the two solar cells facing opposite directions, as shown in Fig. 2. In its rest position, the solar cells both receive an equal amount of sunlight, as the angle of incidence, although not 90°, is equal in both cases as seen in Fig. 3.},
