"[Bandit-Based Solar Panel Control](http://cs.brown.edu/~dabel/papers/iaai_solar_bandit.pdf)" presented at IAAI 2018, with earlier versions of the paper appearing at [RLDM 2017](http://cs.brown.edu/~dabel/papers/solarl.pdf) and [EnviroInfo 2017](http://cs.brown.edu/~dabel/papers/solarl_enviro_info.pdf).

This work focuses on applying reinforcement learning techniques to improve Solar Tracking.

Experiments require [pysolar](http://pysolar.org/) version [0.6](https://github.com/pingswept/pysolar/releases/tag/0.6), and [simple_rl](https://github.com/david-abel/simple_rl), which can be installed with the usual:

	pip install simple_rl


## Example

To reproduce plots from the IAAI paper, simply run the _run_all_experiments.py_ in _experiments_.
